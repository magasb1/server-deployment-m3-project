# Server Deploment - Module 3 - Project

We have already learnt how to deploy hosted solutions and add features such as authentication, files, and databases. In this module, we will create one big application using all the knowledge we have gained from previous modules and courses.
In this module, we will create an Express application with S3 storage and OpenID Connect. We will deploy the application to Cyclic.sh and create a Docker container for the application.
In this lesson, we will focus on application implementation. We will overview the project and implement most functionalities in the local environment.
